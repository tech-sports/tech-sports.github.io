		Passenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring islands such as Water Island,
		Saint John, Saint Croix, and the British Virgin Islands run regularly out of the Red

		The United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United States jurisdiction where 
		the rule of the road is to <strong class="drive">drive on the left.</strong> This was inherited from what was the then-current 
		Danish practice at the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because the islands are a U.S.
		territory, most cars are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is 
		located on the left side of the vehicle.
